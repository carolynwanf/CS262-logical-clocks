# Map of the repo
## Running the model
To run our model, compile and run `./threadManager.cc`. This file uses data structures and functions from `./dataStructures.h`, `./handleSockets.h`, and `./threadHandler.h`.

## Trials
Our trials are included in the folders `./baselineTrials`, `./clockSpeedRangeTrials`, `./higherSendProbabilityTrials`, and `./lowerClockSpeedVariationTrials`.

## Analysis
Our analysis is in the Jupyter Notebook `./logicalClockAnalysis.ipnyb`.

## Tests
Our tests are in the `./test` folder.

## Other implementations
We attempted other implementations: a gRPC implementation in the `./gRPC Implementation` folder that we abandoned because it became too complicated, and a shared memory implementation in the `./sharedMemoryImplementation` folder that we abandoned after a post was made on canvas saying that this model was bad.
